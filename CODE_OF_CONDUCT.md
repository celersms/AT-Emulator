# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of the **AT Emulator** pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring environment for all contributors, where constructive and respectful collaboration is prioritized.  

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:  

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:  

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of
unacceptable behavior.  

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this
Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and to public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of the project may be
defined by project maintainers.  

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project author [Victor Celer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-celer/).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project maintainers.
